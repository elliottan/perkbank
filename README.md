# Perkbank
The Perkbank online system may be found at: https://perkbank.herokuapp.com/.
The GitHub repository may be found at: https://github.com/elliottan/perkbank.

## Description
This prototype represents a small portion of the functionalities that the proposed solution will have. It runs purely as a single-page application, without connections to a backend web server nor any database servers. A basic registration feature is available that will allow you to log-in using a newly created account during the same session. Also, the front-facing payment request form that clients will use to submit payment order requests may be found in the "New" tab.

### Frameworks
The web application was conceived with an Angular front-end, and basic Node.js server for deployment to Heroku.

## Running the prototype
Navigate to the Heroku application link provided above, and you will be greeted by the landing page. This page will probably be ommitted from the final product, as clients and employees should use separate links to access the system.

### Logging in
There is already a preloaded account with username "admin" and password "admin" that you can use to log in. Enter "1234" as the authentication 2FA code to complete the login process.

## Closing remarks
We have also developed screen mockups for the remaining proposed features, available in the executive summary.
